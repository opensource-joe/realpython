Speakers: Neal Ford & Venkat Subramaniam

Offered once a month on O'Reilly, driven by participant's questions.

- Book: Practices of an Agile Developer
    - Tooling - a lot more tools today for developing collaboratively. Would go back and revisit for current tools.
    - Practices today are timeless - attitude to focus on problems than fixing blame on people.
    - Unit tests are "angels on my shoulder," b/c something says this code is no good and don't publish. Occasionally listen to angel by devil is on my shoulder.

- Languages - C++, Java, JS, Groovy, Kotland
    - Writing code is like a way to write a poem.
    - Beauty of programming language - never care about syntax, more you code the easier it becomes. More about how to express an idea and implications of doing it.
    - Expressiveness of language - meta-programming and take further to DSLs.
    - Two opinions: 1) languages are like vehicles, 2) never want to be an 'x' language programmer. You are a problem solver and language is a tool.
    - Most modern languages have taken away annoying concepts like memory management, co-routines, mixins, etc.
    - Democratization of programming languages: can mixin various languages.

- Intersection of programming language and architecture.
    - Impact of language and architecture.
    - Parts that make a system - not all parts are the same. 
    - System architecture needs to be rigid and flexible depending on demands of use.
    - Meta-programming - python.
    - Language choice based on characteristics wanted.

- Polyglot. Opinions about companies that don't like [polyglot](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/polyglot-programming#:~:text=Polyglot%20programming%20is%20the%20practice,practice%20for%20enterprise%20application%20development.).
    - Don't use the word simplicity. Is it simple or familiar or comfortable?
    - Look at it from business and economics point of view. What provides most agility?
    - A log ot companies focused on micro services, but may not need to do it, more about ability to do so.
    - There is never one way to do something.
    - Biases and infatuation lead to solution and consider problems after.
    - Evaluate based on pros and cons.
    - Consider the competition, if don't consider agility, the competition will do so.
    - Consider as an opportunity to upgrade skills over time.
    - Should be more about business versus technology choice.

- Making architecture agile.
    - Make decision about reversability. Ability to back out of a solution.
    - Languages are hard to reverse.
    - Want designed for reversability.
    - Do active prototyping.
    - Sometimes decisions get made on biases and heresay. Want to work on fact and not fate. Work on prototype with stress test. Then bring in to architecture.
    - Don't build a framework or infrastructure, focus on building a product. Build in vertical slices, not horizontal layers.
    - Consider global optimization, not local optimization.

- Architect role.
    - In a lot of companies, the word architect means "I don't code anymore."
    - As an architect, leverage team to build architecture.
    - Consider architect to be a foreman, collaborate with team members, lead them in certain direction.
    - Don't be a power point architect. Can not versus will not.
    - Pair with developer to learn about developing code for application. 
    - Usually a technical designer and an information flow.

- Becoming a polygot programmer.
    - Learn a different a language every year. Rather, learn a language that is different than what I know.
    - Language is a design tool, should make you think differently.
    - Usually want to learn what needs to be learned for the job. Should want to learn things that have no immediate use b/c it re-wires mind for design.
    - Learning is non-linear.
    - Start with a problem and figure out, then refactor as you learn more about the language and code.
    - Makes you a better programmer to learn new languages.
    - Learning the first language is easy, learning the second is difficult.

- Increasing influence of data and data architecture. Need to start thinking of date too.
    - When programmer, need to be expert in one thing. Deep focus on one narrow area.
    - Architect needs to become broad thinking in an area. Look at multiple different topics and make choices.
    - Architect needs to know breadth of multiple topics. Bring together individuals to evaluate technologies.

- Technical debt and parts of solution not developed with agile.
    - Make it work, make it better real soon. 
    - Do less with more quality, than more with less quality.
    - Continuously refactor and improve quality.

- Keeping up to date with industry and tools and techniques.
    - O'Reilly platform - be curious
    - Look for conferences - great way to learn from others
    - Be part of local user groups - so many in town and great way to learn what others doing in their orgs
    - Within own org - organize brown bag, someone come to talk about something outside project
